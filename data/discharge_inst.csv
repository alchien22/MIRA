Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at ___. You 
were admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely 
that this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from 
your cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid 
was removed, your pain improved significantly. You were noted to 
have a high potassium during your hospitalization, which came 
down with treatment but this should continue to be followed as 
an outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a 
representative from hospice. Because of your repeated 
paracenteses, we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex 
catheter placement. We arranged for you to meet with hospice 
coordinators, and you will be discharged home with hospice.

We wish you all the best!

Your ___ care team
