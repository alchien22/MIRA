# Goals of care:  The patient expressed that her desire to ""let 
go"" and be at peace. She is tired of ""fighting"" her end stage 
liver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of 
life. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice, 
which we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would 
like to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the 
patient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably 
be DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP). 
Therefore, at this time, she remains full code. We also 
discussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter 
placed because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged 
to home with hospice on ___.

# Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient 
presented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed 
with tramadol and morphine. She underwent ___ paracentesis 
on ___ with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies 
on the fluid were negative, and she reported a significant 
improvement in her pain.
 
# Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization, it was noted that 
she had hyperkalemia 5.3 -> 5.9 -> 6.9 without EKG changes. 
After treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2, insulin and D50 x 
2, and kayexelate, her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been 
persistently elevated in the past and should continue to be 
monitored.

# Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status was A+Ox3 
on admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose 
in-house and at discharge.
