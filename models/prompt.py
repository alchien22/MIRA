You will receive the retrieval **Context** and a model **Answer**.
Your task is to evaluate how consistent the answer is with the context.

Respond in **2 steps** using the exact format below, and **end with <END_CRITIC>**.

Step 1: Write 2-4 sentences explaining whether the answer is well-supported by the context. Focus on whether each claim in the answer is grounded in the provided information.

Step 2: Provide a consistency score from 1 to 100 based on the following scale:
- 100: All claims in the answer are directly supported by the context.
- 50: Some claims are supported by the context, but others are missing or contradictory.
- 0: No claims in the answer are supported by the context.
